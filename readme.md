gitIssues App:

A web App to get the Issues in a repositoiry.

It gives the user all basic details of the repository, total issues, issues in last 24 hours, issues older than 24 hours but less than 7 days old and issues older than 7 days.

Have tried to make the information easy to understand and user friendly. Also all the corner cases have been considered.

Frontend-React, Redux.
